    "Yesterday I received an email from an entrepreneur. He came up with the idea that he wanted to open a bar in New York. At the moment there are already many different bars in New York. This therefore ensures a good number of competition. To outsmart the competition, the entrepreneur was looking for the most suitable location. The entrepreneur was already thinking of questions such as: are there hotels nearby? how many other bars are there in the area? are there other places of entertainment nearby?\n",

    "It is the largest borough geographically and is adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn, at the western end of Long Island. To its east is Nassau County. Queens also shares water borders with the boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island (via the Rockaways). The borough of Queens is the second-largest in population. \n",

    "Queens has the most diversified economy of the five boroughs of New York City. It is home to John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, both among the world's busiest, which in turn makes the airspace above Queens among the busiest in the United States. Landmarks in Queens include Flushing Meadowsâ€“Corona Park; Citi Field, home to the New York Mets baseball team; the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, site of the US Open tennis tournament; Kaufman Astoria Studios; Silvercup Studios; and Aqueduct Racetrack."
